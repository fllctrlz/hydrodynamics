	<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<br>
	<p>When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height, balance, drive train,
	sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. We also strive to design and build a base robot which
	is robust and which features a frame around the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square up against walls
	and mission models. <!--Before creating a prototype base robot, we prepare some high level rudimentary drawings on a flip chart
	which we use to stimulate discussion amongst team members. Once the team settles on a high-level base robot design, we use LDD
	or ML CAD to create a 3D-drawing of the prototype. Doing so allows us to be as efficient as possible with regard to type and quantity
	of pieces used. Based on the final drawing, we construct our prototype base robot using LEGO pieces/elements. After creating a working
	prototype,--> We design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be
	easy to install and remove, robust, and both passive and multi-purpose whenever possible. From testing the prototype base robot and
	the attachments, we make revisions to our work in order to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve
	maximum efficiency. By the end of the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.</p>

		<h2>Examples of Robotic Testing Conducted by Ctrl-Z </h2>
	<br>
	<h4>Finding the Optimal Set of Color Sensors for our Robot</h4>
	<p>When first designing our robot we wanted to make sure that all the light/color sensors behaved similarly.
	Color sensors each return small differences in readings because of variations in manufacturing.
	For example, if you were to place two different color sensors on the same black line,
	each would return different values for light intensity.
	Sometimes the difference may be significant. To make sure that
	all our light sensors had about the same reading we completely shielded ten color sensors to eliminate the
	variable of ambient light and recorded the reading
	for each of the color sensors on black, white, and green. We then found the three color sensors which have the
	closest reading to each other and used those three color sensors on the robot.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Making the Robot Drive Straight</h4>
	<p>We have found the the green EV3 move blocks (Move Tank and Move Steering) are unreliable.
	Although they have a built in PID feature, they still do not move the robot in a straight line. To test this,
	we set a designated starting spot for the robot and then we ran it until it hit the wall on
	the other side of the table. We repeated this dozens of times and found that each time it 
	would end up in a different spot on the other side of the table. Each time it would be up to one 
	inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error-corrected
	move block (which you can read about in the programming section of this website). We conducted the same experiment
	using our block and found that there was much less error and the robot would consistently
	end up in the same position on the table.

	<br>
		<p>Our base robot is very robust and compact with a frame for strength. We also have three light sensors and a gyro sensor, for maximum flexibility, 
		with shielding from ambient light. The robot’s main drive wheels are large in diameter and small in thickness to make up for this year’s field’s long travel routes. 
		However, we sacrifice some accuracy due to our large diameter wheels which increase the error associated with the drive motor.  
		The robot uses small wheels without rubber on them as sliders, as to be steering neutral. Our modular design and attachment bay allows the robot driver to install and remove 
		attachments quickly and accurately, while our brain’s positioning allows for easy swapping of batteries.

			 The first mission that it will complete is the fountain mission, using a passive device activated by an arm hitting the fountain to drop a big water into the basin with 
			 enough force to raise the fountain. As it progresses, it will use one arm to simultaneously drop the tripod into its target, flush the toilet and extend the arm carrying 
			 the Slingshot, while slowly lowering another arm which will later drop off the well.  When it hits the east wall, it will complete the sink mission and suspend 
			 the Slingshot over the target.</td>
