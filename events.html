<h2>Prime Minister's Science Fair</h2>
<br>	
	<p>
	Imagine if a teacher asked you to concisely summarize everything you learned over 
	a school year in under two minutes. On September 26, 2017 we, as members of the Ctrl-Z 
	Bayview Glen robotics team, were faced with a similar challenge, but instead we were 
	asked by the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In September 2017, Ctrl-Z was invited to represent <i>FIRST</i>Canada at the inaugural 
	Prime Minister's Science Fair held on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. There were 28 other
	students selected from across Canada (BC, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, PEI, and 
	Newfoundland) to showcase their science projects at the event.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	After arriving at around 10:30 p.m., we had to prepare for the big event the 
	following day by charging the robot's batteries, lining up team materials, and 
	most importantly learning how to iron our team jerseys!
	</p>
 
	<p>
	The next morning, all 30 participants of the Science Fair gathered their projects 
	and loaded them onto the coach bus that would be transporting the group over the 
	course of the day. The first stop was the Wellington Building, just down the street
	from Parliament. Here, all the students would participate in a round table meeting 
	with the Minister of Science, Kirsty Duncan, and the President of NSERC (Natural 
	Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada), Dr. Mario Pinto. Without 
	their science projects in hand, all the students and chaperones entered the building.
	Due to high security, it took almost an hour to make it to the meeting room, 
	but it was well worth the effort. Each seat had a microphone and a set of headphones,
	and there was even a live translator for participants to hear simultaneous 
	interpretation of French and English language. First, each student made introductory
	remarks to the Minister. Then the students each spoke about their 
	science project, from a 10-year old student talking about the effects of advertising
	on the human senses to a 17-year old student describing research on cancer therapy
	with Nano technology. All found it inspirational to hear the students share their 
	passion and to hear Minister Duncan and Dr. Pinto speak about their goals and how 
	important it was for Canada’s future that youth be involved in STEM.              
	</p>
 
	<p>
	Following Minister Duncan’s round table, the students ate a light lunch and then 
	boarded the bus for the final stop at the Langevin Block, the Office of the Prime
	Minister and Privy Council. This time, the students entered the building without 
	the chaperones. Everyone unloaded their projects from the bus and brought them to
	security for inspection. We were given thirty minutes to set up our showcase,
	consisting of two 4’ x 8’ display boards, trophies, robot and playing field, 
	and Pinder Pet Finder innovative solution.  For the next hour, almost two dozen
	Members of Parliament visited our showcase. We demonstrated our autonomous robot 
	and research project and discussed our accomplishments, all that we had learned, 
	and how we have inspired other youth to get involved with STEM.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	As the MP’s cleared out, guards secured all the entrances, and Justin Trudeau, 
	accompanied by Dr. Mona Nemer, newly appointed Chief Science Advisor, Kirsty 
	Duncan, Minister of Science, and an entire film crew, came up the stairs, and 
	made their way to the end of the hall. As the students lined up side by side, 
	the Prime Minister listened to their presentations one by one. Then, it was 
	time for us to deliver our presentation. We had less than two minutes to explain
	everything to our audience. With all the practice over the years and the good 
	luck from our oversized Canada hats that we wore at the <i>FIRST</i> Championships, 
	we nailed the presentation. The Prime Minister was extremely impressed by how
	much Ctrl-Z has done to inspire youth, including mentoring a First Nations
	team in Toronto. In saying farewell, we gave Prime Minister Trudeau one of
	our Canada hats to remember Bayview Glen and the Ctrl-Z robotics team.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We will never forget our visit to Ottawa and how honoured we were to represent
	BVG and <i>FIRST</i> Canada in meeting with Canada’s leaders.

	<h2>FLL Ontario HYDRO DYNAMICS Season Kick-off and Training Event</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Saturday, September 23, 2017, Ctrl-Z presented to many new and returning teams (over 280 attendees) at
	the FLL HYDRODYNAMICS Season Kick-off and Training Event hosted at Bayview Glen School. There, the team refreshed and
	helped improve many enthusiasts' building, programming, and research skills. It shared various concepts, from
	introductory to advanced, to help other teams make the best of this year’s season.

	<br>
	<p>
	Over the course of the HYDRO DYNAMICS season, Ctrl-Z mentored FLL Team #16569 Heat Wave, consisting of grade 5 and grade 6 students from Glastonbury, Connecticut.  We assisted our friends in Connecticut with robot (building and programming) and research project on bi-weekly Skype meetings.  Congratulations to 
	Heat Wave and Coach Wendy on winning Champion’s Award -1st Place (Wolcott Championship Award).  Well deserved!!!!

	<h2>Presenting our ANIMAL ALLIES Innovative Solution At Lakeside Process Controls Ltd.</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On October 23, 2017, members of Ctrl-Z were invited by Lakeside Process Controls Ltd. to deliver presentations describing their 
	ANIMAL ALLIES innovative solution, the Pinder Pet Finder smart collar, their robot, and the team’s 2017 <i>FIRST</i> Championships experience to 
	approximately 80 engineers at the Company’s head office in Mississauga. The audience was impressed by the sophistication of the team’s programs 
	which are used to create a fully autonomous robot to complete various missions.  Lakeside team members were gracious in offering to provide 
	technical expertise to Ctrl-Z to assist in advancing this season’s HYDRO DYNAMICS-themed research project.

	<h2>Promoting FLL at the SYNNEX Canada National Conference</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On October 25, 2017, Ctrl-Z  was invited to promote STEM and robotics at the SYNNEX Canada National Conference held at the Toronto Congress Center. 
	When we arrived at the venue, we set up our booth with our Robot, Research and Core Values display boards.  
	We also set up the ANIMAL ALLIES field mat and mission models to demonstrate last year's’ robot.  Here’s how the day went.
 
When we first walked into the tradeshow hall, we were excited to see all of the other exhibitors set up and could not wait to explore all of them. 
We were led to our own booth which had already been decorated with <i>FIRST</i> banners and table covers. We then added our Ctrl-Z display materials to the 
booth. Ctrl-Z team members were the only non-adults present at the event. Slowly but steadily, other exhibitors came to visit our booth. 
 Many questions were asked and answered, such as, what is FLL? and how many parts are there to FLL? We explained our robot’s missions and programming, 
 as well as the Pinder Pet Finder, the team’s innovative solution to reunite lost pets with their families.
 
There were over 300 attendees at the conference. We demonstrated a couple of the robot missions on the ANIMAL ALLIES field and described the robot’s 
movements as our program advanced. For the research project, we demonstrated the Pinder Pet Finder and explained how it worked.  
Ctrl-Z team members really enjoyed the experience and thank SYNNEX Canada for the invitation.  Hopefully we will be invited to future conferences.

	<h2>Promoting STEM at the Ontario Legislative Assembly</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Members of Ctrl-Z were invited by Hon. Reza Moridi, Minister of Research, Innovation and Science to attend Question Period at the Ontario Legislative 
	Assembly on December 11, 2017.  Hon. Kathleen Wynne, Premier of Ontario, introduced the team as follows: <i>“There’s a group of students here today from 
	Bayview Glen School in my riding, and I want to congratulate them because they won first place out of 32,000 other robotics teams worldwide….
	The Ctrl-Z student team members are Matthew Wong, Harrison Cazzin, Alex Alexiev, Chloe Filice, Trent Rossos, Brianna Gonzalez and Daniel Gonzalez. 
	Welcome to Queen’s Park and congratulations.”</i>  All the M.P.P.'s collectively clapped and cheered and it was an amazing feeling when that happened.  
	The team members then watched the proceedings of Question Period from the balcony gallery which was fascinating.   
	Following Question Period, the team members were given an opportunity to speak with both the Premier and the Minister about promoting STEM in the Province.  
	Finally, official photographs with the Premier and Minister were taken on the Grand Staircase.  
	Ctrl-Z expresses its gratitude to Mr. Rambod Afshari for his work in arranging the team’s visit to Queen’s Park.</p>
