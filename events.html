	<h2>FLL Ontario HydroDynamics Season Kick-off and Training Event</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Saturday, September 23, 2017, Ctrl-Z presented to many new and returning teams (over 280 attendees) at
	the FLL HydroDynamics Season Kick-off and Training Event hosted at Bayview Glen School. There, the team refreshed and
	helped improve many enthusiasts' building, programming, and research skills. It shared various concepts, from
	introductory to advanced, to help other teams make the best of this year’s season.

	<h2>Mentoring our FLL Friends in Connecticut</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	Ctrl-Z meets regularly through Skype with Team 16569, our FLL friends from Connecticut. The team met the Connecticut Team at the 2017 Animal Allies World Festival. 
	Ctrl-Z mentors them to help them improve their autonomous robot, and their skit to present their innovative solution.

	<h2>Presenting our Animal Allies Innovative Solution At Lakeside Controls</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On October 23, 2017, members of Ctrl-Z were invited by Lakeside Process Controls Ltd. to deliver presentations describing their 
	ANIMAL ALLIES innovative solution, the Pinder Pet Finder smart collar, their robot, and the team’s 2017FIRST Championships experience to 
	approximately 80 engineers at the Company’s head office in Mississauga. The audience was impressed by the sophistication of the team’s programs 
	which are used to create a fully autonomous robot to complete various missions.  Lakeside team members were gracious in offering to provide 
	technical expertise to Ctrl-Z to assist in advancing this season’s HYDRO DYNAMICS-themed research project.

	<h2>Promoting FLL at the SYNNEX Canada National Conference</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On October 25, 2017, Ctrl-Z  was invited to promote STEM and robotics at the SYNNEX Canada National Conference held at the Toronto Congress Center. 
	When we arrived at the venue, we set up our booth with our Robot, Research and Core Values display boards.  
	We also set up the ANIMAL ALLIES field mat and mission models to demonstrate last year's’ robot.  Here’s how the day went.
 
When we first walked into the tradeshow hall, we were excited to see all of the other exhibitors set up and could not wait to explore all of them. 
We were led to our own booth which had already been decorated with FIRST banners and table covers. We then added our Ctrl-Z display materials to the 
booth. Ctrl-Z team members were the only non-adults present at the event. Slowly but steadily, other exhibitors came to visit our booth. 
 Many questions were asked and answered, such as, what is FLL? and how many parts are there to FLL? We explained our robot’s missions and programming, 
 as well as the Pinder Pet Finder, the team’s innovative solution to reunite lost pets with their families.
 
There were over 300 attendees at the conference. We demonstrated a couple of the robot missions on the ANIMAL ALLIES field and described the robot’s 
movements as our program advanced. For the research project, we demonstrated the Pinder Pet Finder and explained how it worked.  
Ctrl-Z team members really enjoyed the experience and thank SYNNEX Canada for the invitation.  Hopefully we will be invited to future conferences.
